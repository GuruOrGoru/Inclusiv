# Inclusiv — The Inclusive Job Portal You Didn’t Know You Needed

---

## Introduction

Welcome to **Inclusiv**, a job portal that’s a little different from the others. You might be wondering: why build another job board? Well, let me tell you a story.

Imagine you’re a talented individual with a disability or from an underrepresented community. You have the skills, the drive, and the passion—but every time you try to find a job, the listings either ignore accessibility, flexibility, or plain old human decency. You scroll through hundreds of postings that don’t mention whether the workplace accommodates your needs. You wonder if the company even *cares* about inclusion or if you’ll have to jump through hoops just to be considered.

Inclusiv was born out of this frustration. It’s a place where job seekers like you don’t have to guess or hope for the best. A place that speaks your language, looks out for your needs, and makes job hunting less of a guessing game and more of a hopeful journey.

## What is Inclusiv?

Inclusiv is an AI-powered job portal focused entirely on **inclusivity**. It carefully filters job listings to highlight those that truly embrace accessibility, diversity, and flexibility. Our mission? To bring transparency to hiring practices and to help companies who *actually* care connect with the talent they deserve.

---

## How Does Inclusiv Work?

Behind the scenes, Inclusiv fetches jobs from reputable sources like Greenhouse and others. But here’s the secret sauce: instead of just dumping every job on your screen, it uses a smart blend of AI and carefully crafted logic to analyze each posting’s language. It looks for accessibility terms, diversity statements, remote work options, and flexible policies.

That means you see job listings that:

- Talk about wheelchair accessibility  
- Explicitly mention remote work or flexible schedules  
- Have clear diversity and inclusion statements  
- Use language that doesn’t make you feel like you’re solving a mystery just to understand if the role fits you  

And because our backend is written in Go, it’s not just smart — it’s lightning fast.

---

## Why Should You Care?

Because most job portals were made for the “average” job seeker — and guess what? The “average” person doesn’t exist. We all come with unique needs and stories. Inclusiv recognizes this diversity and caters to it.

Think of Inclusiv like that friendly neighborhood barista who *actually* remembers your name and how you like your coffee — only here, it’s about remembering and respecting your accessibility and inclusion needs.

## A Peek Under the Hood

You don’t need to be a techie to use Inclusiv, but if you are curious — the backend is a robust Go application that pulls data from various Greenhouse job boards. It then analyzes those jobs using AI models or custom logic to score inclusivity and filter accordingly.

The frontend is designed to be clean, accessible, and straightforward, so you won’t need a manual to figure out how to find your next inclusive opportunity.

## Who Built Inclusiv?

Inclusiv is the brainchild of a passionate developer who believes technology can help level the playing field. The goal isn’t just to build another app, but to create a tool that makes a real difference for people often left out.

---

## What’s Next?

This is just the beginning. Future plans include:

- Adding more job sources so you get an even wider range of inclusive jobs  
- Improving AI to provide better inclusivity scores and transparency  
- Adding notifications to alert you when inclusive jobs matching your profile pop up  
- Creating a space for employers who *really* walk the talk on diversity and inclusion

## How to Use Inclusiv

If you believe in that too, welcome aboard.

It just needs you.
